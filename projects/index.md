<h3> Current Projects </h3>

<p>I am the Platform Director for SeatGeek Open, a revolutionary primary ticketing system system being developed by secondary market ticketing powerhouse <a target="_new" href="http://seatgeek.com/">SeatGeek</a>. I view this as a phenomenal chance to lead an innovative company's push into the wild world of primary market ticketing, and to build not just another ticketing system, but a new kind of platform for open distribution of tickets between rightsholders (teams, promoters, etc.) and distribution partners like startups, exchanges, and brokers looking to do innovative things with tickets. Everything we're doing with SeatGeek Open is with the goal of providing greater, more fluid access to tickets and generating more opportunities to engage with fans looking to attend live events.</p>

<p>This role allows me to bring my experience at Pogoseat (more below), working with each of the major U.S. primary ticketing systems for the past two years, and my experience building large scale data management systems for NASA (more even further below) to help ensure that this effort has a strong technical foundation and a bright future. I'm excited to be able to build a product that desperately needs to exist (the general fan opinion of the current market leader's offerings (ahem, Ticketmaster) is less than stellar), and to work with some of the brightest and most talented engineers I've ever had the pleasure to meet.</p>

<h3> Past Projects </h3>

<p>I served as CTO of <a href="https://pogoseat.com/" target="_new">Pogoseat, Inc.</a>, a venture-backed startup based in Venice Beach, CA from 2014-2016. Pogoseat developed tools to help fans get the best possible experience at live events. From a technical perspective, this involved maintaining real-time integration with all of the major U.S. ticketing system APIs, handling synchronization of inventory with each team's box office, and implementation of algorithmic pricing models to maximize value to both the fan and the team. Despite being the underdog in our market, the platform Pogoseat built for seat and VIP upgrades was widely acclaimed. However, I'm most thankful for the opportunity to build and lead a team of talented , motivated engineers who were each passionate about employing technology to improve the fan experience at live events.</p>

<p>From 2007-2014 I worked as a software engineer in the Data Management Systems and
Technologies group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In that capacity I
had the unique opportunity to participate in the research, design, and development of
large-scale data systems to support a broad spectrum of scientific research:
