I presently serve as the CTO of Pogoseat, Inc., a venture-backed startup in Venice Beach, California. We're developing powerful new technology to make sure that you get the best possible
experience at live events. From a technical perspective, this involves maintaining deep integration with all of the major ticketing system's APIs, real-time inventory synchronization with the primary ticket sales box office, and algorithmic pricing models to maximize value to the fan and the team. The Pogoseat platform for seat and VIP upgrades is second-to-none, and we are passionate about continuing to lead through innovation and engineering talent.

    <p>Pogoseat's technology takes has evolved from prototype to platform in the past 18 months, and we have some exciting offerings on the horizon that we believe will redefine what it means to implement seat and VIP upgrade programs at live events.</p>
    <p>As CTO, my job is to maintain the high-level vision while also thoroughly understanding the low-level details. Every day, I work hands-on with our engineering team to coordinate effort, prototype and iterate features, and maintain a lean, agile development process.</p>
    <p>As someone who delights in building robust, innovative software used by thousands of people, Pogoseat is a dream job. You can learn more about what we're doing on our <a href="http://pogoseat.com/" target="_new">website</a>.</p>

### Past Projects:

![NASA Logo]({{ "/images/logos/nasa.jpeg" | prepend: site.base_url }} "meatball!")

From 2007-2014 I worked as a software engineer in the Data Management Systems and
Technologies group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In that capacity I
had the unique opportunity to participate in the research, design, and development of
large-scale data systems to support a broad spectrum of scientific research:
