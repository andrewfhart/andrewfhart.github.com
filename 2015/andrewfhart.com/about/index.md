Hi there --- I'm Andrew Hart, an entrepreneurial software engineer working in Los Angeles, CA. I'm into Bitcoin, playing with &quot;Big Data&quot;, and, in general, whatever the latest technology craze happens to be. I am a voracious reader, and enjoy the challenge of wrapping my head (and hands) around challenging problems.

I've worked in a wide variety of environments, from [university research labs](http://scec.usc.edu) to [tiny start-up](https://www.pogoseat.com) to [national space agency](http://jpl.nasa.gov). Each has provided me with unique and valuable perspectives and lessons on the fine art and science of software development.

I'm currently the CTO of [Pogoseat, Inc.](https://pogoseat.com/), a venture-backed startup based in Venice Beach, CA., developing an exciting new way to make sure you get the best possible experience at live events. On any given day I could be working with the engineers to optimize our mobile app's performance, polish and extend our REST API, or helping to refine the product road-map with the business development guys.

When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I'm usually out taking photographs. Travel and photography are two passions of mine that go well together, and I've taken every opportunity to get out and [see the world]({{ site_url}} /travel), always with [my camera](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d7100), of course:

## About the Site

Andrewfhart.com has been on the web in one form or another since 2005. I bought the domain name at the time with the aim of putting together a digital portfolio of my work. The various incarnations of the site roughly track the technology learning curve I took, evolving from static, hand-written HTML + CSS, to a database-backed version built with [Furnace]({{site.url}}{% post_url /projects/2014-01-01-Furnace-PHP%}), to a completely rewritten version using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) + [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), to the present, more extensible version, which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a [web template system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) with excellent support for rapid, relatively [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) development.

The template for this site is based off of the incredible "mademistakes" Jekyll [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll) originally written by Michael Rose. I was drawn to it by its simplicity, and by the degree to which it allows content to retain the focus.
