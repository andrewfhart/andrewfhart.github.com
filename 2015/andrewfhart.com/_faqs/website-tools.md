The core technology behind this website is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generation tool written in Ruby that takes a collection of templates and
a little bit of logic, and generates static HTML files that comprise the content that is actually served up in response to requests. Since this is a personal website that does not update constantly or serve visitor-specific views, there really wasn't any need for the heavy-weight approach of a database-driven content management system. Other tools used include:

* Text editor: [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com)
* Task runner: [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
* Version control: Git + GitHub
* Web hosting: [Linode](http://linode.com)
