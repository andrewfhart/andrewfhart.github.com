## Follow Me

I am fairly easy to find on various social networks. I post quite infrequently, but if social netorking is your thing, I can be "followed" here:

<div class="inline">
  <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewfhart" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Twitter follow');" class="btn-social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i> Twitter</a>
  <a href="http://instagram.com/andrewfhart" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Instagram follow');" class="btn-social instagram"><i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instagram</a>
</div>

## Send a Donation

I include a few banner ads on the site to help offset the costs associated with keeping this site up, but pretty much no one clicks on that crap these days. So if you'd like to send donations my way, feel free to do so by hitting sending me [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/).

<div class="inline">
  <a href="https://coinbase.com/checkouts/1557eJtTf38DTL9s6tBpYhFxrFpLi7S8Pa" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Send Bitcoins');" class="btn"><i class="fa fa-bitcoin"></i> Send Bitcoin</a>
</div>
