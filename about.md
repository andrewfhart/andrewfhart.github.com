Hi there --- I'm Andrew Hart, an entrepreneur and software engineer working in sunny Los Angeles, California.

I'm currently the CTO of [Pogoseat, Inc.](https://pogoseat.com/), a venture-backed startup based in Venice Beach, CA. We're developing a powerful new way to make sure you get the best possible experience at live events. On any given day I might be managing our engineering team, digging through data to find ways to optimize the performance of our mobile app and REST APIs, or working to refine the product road-map with the business development folks.

I am able to draw upon experience gained from working in a wide variety of environments, from [university research lab](http://scec.usc.edu) to [early start-up](https://www.pogoseat.com) to [national space agency](http://jpl.nasa.gov). Each has provided me with unique and valuable perspectives and lessons on the art and science of software development.

When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I'm usually out taking photographs. Travel and photography are two longstanding passions of mine that go well together, and I've taken every opportunity to get out and see the world, always with [my camera](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d7100), of course.

## About this Site

Andrewfhart.com has been on the web in one form or another since 2005. I bought the domain name at the time with the aim of putting together a digital portfolio of my work. The various incarnations of the site roughly track the technology learning curve I took, evolving from static, hand-written HTML + CSS, to a database-backed version built with [Furnace]({{site.url}}{% post_url /projects/2014-01-01-Furnace-PHP%}), to a completely rewritten version using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) + [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), to the present, more extensible version, which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a [web template system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) with excellent support for rapid, relatively [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) development.
