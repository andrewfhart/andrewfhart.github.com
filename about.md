Hi there --- I'm Andrew Hart, an entrepreneur and software engineer working in New York City.

</a>
By day I am Platform Director for [SeatGeek Open](http://seatgeek.com/open), a modern, open platform for primary ticketing, from SeatGeek, the best ticket buying experience on the Web. Based in New York City, we're developing a modern box office that is mobile, flexible, and widely accessible - perfectly built for teams and artists looking to reach more fans and create richer experiences.

I am able to draw upon experience gained from working in a wide variety of environments, from [university research lab](http://scec.usc.edu) to [early stage start-up](https://www.pogoseat.com) to [national space agency](http://jpl.nasa.gov). Each has provided me with unique and valuable perspectives and lessons on the art and science of software development.

When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I'm usually taking photographs. Travel and photography are two longstanding passions of mine that go well together, and I take every possible opportunity to get out and go see the world, always with [my camera](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d7100), of course.

## About this Site

Andrewfhart.com has been on the web in one form or another since 2005. I bought the domain name at the time with the aim of putting together a digital portfolio of my work. The various incarnations of the site roughly track the technology learning curve I took, evolving from static, hand-written HTML + CSS, to a database-backed version built with [Furnace]({{site.url}}{% post_url /projects/2014-01-01-Furnace-PHP%}), to a completely rewritten version using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) + [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), to the present, more extensible version, which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a [web template system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) with excellent support for rapid, relatively [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) development.
