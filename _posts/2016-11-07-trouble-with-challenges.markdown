## The trouble with "challenges"

Yesterday a friend asked me if I wanted to participate in a Plank Challenge. Basically, this is an attempt to gradually increase the amount of time you can maintain a Plank position, ostensibly gaining core strength in the process. Here's the gist of the challenge:

> Each day for 30 days we'll do a timed plank, starting at 20 seconds, and increasing by 10 seconds every day, until we get to 300 seconds.

I had the feeling that there was something wrong with this idea, but at the time was not able to express my reservations adequately. Having thought further about this, I can now concretely say: this is a bad(ly formed) idea.

My initial concern was injury. Proper form for planking requires a strong core, and most beginners, reaching the point of fatigue, begin to slump their midsection down until their body resembles a gentle `U`, risking injury by placing stress on the vertebrae of the lower spine.

More importantly, however, there's a problem with the structure of this challenge: done by itself, with no additional behavioral change, there is a zero percent chance of acheiving the target. Here's why.

The target of 300 seconds is fifteen times as long as the starting time. A 15x improvement in strength does not come for free. Not ever. And yet, the challenge seems to imply that the participant will acheive a 15x improvement through an average of just 2.5 minutes of effort each day (some days as little as 20 seconds, maximum daily effort of 5 minutes). On the face of it, it should be obvious that this can not be done. A muscle does not grow after 20 seconds of effort.

The problem here is a misunderstanding of the difference between *training* and *measurement*. The challenge, as stated, is fundamentally an act of *measuring* the change in your ability over time. It is **not** training. That is left as an (wait for it...) exercise for the participant.

To see this clearly, consider weight loss as an example. You would never assume that you could lose 15 pounds simply by standing on the scale every morning for 30 days. You might step on the scale daily to *measure* your progress, but you'd definitely engage in other activity as well, and that activity would be what drives the results.

Weight is measured by stepping on a scale; strength is measured by timing how long it takes to exhaust muscles. Each act measures, and nothing more.

In simple terms, it is not enough to simply measure your way to a 15x improvement in strength, you have to **train**. Do something strenuous each day to strengthen your core, and then *measure* your progress by doing the timed test that the challenge prescribes.

Train, then measure. Then repeat. That's the way to make progress. If you just measure and repeat, you're going nowhere, and might get hurt trying.
