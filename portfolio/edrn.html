            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The Early Detection Research Network is an effort funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute tasked with the identification and validation of biomarkers (biological indicators) for early detection of cancer. </p>
            <p>The research is conducted by a collection of roughly 40 U.S. institutions, each pursuing independent but complementary studies. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has acted as the Informatics Center for the network since 2001, and has been charged with supporting the diverse data-sharing needs of the distributed research network.

            <h2>How I Contributed</h2>
            <p>My first role on the project was to <em>develop a relational database schema and 
                corresponding web application</em>
                to facilitate data collection by EDRN curation experts. The user interface
                had to accommodate the EDRN&#39;s hierarchical data model and allow curators to enter
                data at the correct "level." Time saving features such as <em>automatically retrieving 
                and assimilating relevant data from the NIH&#39;s PubMed medical publication database</em> and
                convenience features like AJAX-based auto-completion contributed to rapid 
                adoption and a reduction in annotation errors.
