            <p>Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Andrew moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California. He graduated 
            from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering with a B.S. in Computer Science (minor in Multimedia and Creative Studies) in 2005, and a
            M.S. (emphasis in Software Engineering) in 2007.</p>
            <p>After graduating, Andrew joined a team developing ground data system software for scientific research missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
            As a software engineer, and later as a co-investigator there, Andrew participated in and led design and development of innovative
            tools and services for a wide variety of data-intensive

       <p><img class="thumbnail" src="asdf" style="float:left;width:120px;margin-right:20px;margin-top:8px;"/>Andrew Hart is the CTO at Pogoseat, a Los Angeles-based, venture-backed start up developing an innovative technology platform to enable sports fans to upgrade seats and purchase unique experiences during live events. As the technical lead at Pogoseat, Andrew's day-to-day responsibilities include management of its extremely talented engineering team, participation in technical discussions with clients and partners, and oversight of the company's core product development.</p>

        <p>As an early-stage technology startup, Pogoseat is intently focused on feature development and the acquisition of new clients. At this crucial stage in the company's evolution, managing complexity and remaining agile are critical to retaining the ability to scale rapidly and to accommodate diverse client needs. Andrew brings his experience conceptualizing and developing scalable data systems at NASA, and deep connections to the open source community via his membership in the Apache Software Foundation, to bear in guiding Pogoseat's technical evolution from prototype to platform.</p>
