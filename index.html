        <h3>Hello, World!</h3>

<p>Thanks for stopping by! Welcome to the personal home page of Andrew F. Hart, a software engineer and entrepreneur living and working in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<h3>A Bit About Myself...</h3>

<p>I am a <strong>software engineer</strong>. That is, I use computer science to solve problems. I have applied my skills to a variety of situations, most recently as a member of a team developing data management software to support large-scale, data-driven research at NASA.</p>

<p>I consider myself primarily a front-end developer, however I often find myself bridging the gap between front-and-back-end components to better expose the capabilities of the underlying system to end-users via the Web. I strive to design efficient, maintainable software that enable intuitives, streamlined interaction with large quantities of data.</p>

<p>When I'm not developing software, I can usually be found out and about with my camera. Photography is a long-time passion of mine, and you'll more often than not catch me with a camera exploring, investigating, or just searching around for an interesting shot.</p>
